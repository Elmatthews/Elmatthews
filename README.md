Hi, I’m Matthew Amoor 👋
I’m a Data Analyst with a unique background in Integrated Science Education. Initially trained as a teacher, my passion for data and figures led me to transition into the world of data analytics. My educational background and teaching experience has equipped me with strong presentation and communication skills, which I now leverage in my analytics work.

I enjoy transforming raw data into actionable insights and compelling visualizations, and I’m always exploring new tools and techniques to stay ahead in the data field.

I am adept with data analysis and Visualization softwares and tools like Spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets), SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL and BigQuery) for database, and programming languages R and Python. 
Feel free to browse my repositories, check out my projects, and reach out if you’d like to discuss data analytics or potential collaborations!
